## Data and Delivery
- Team 1 has chosen the path of Data Engineering. The industry we have selected is Leisure & Travel. The objective of this project is to explore the most populated cities of the US ranked by the top 5 and bottom 5 affluent States through the lens of household spending. 
- The goal is that the result of the database design will be useful for future users to access and plan their very own vacation by leveraging the table views from SQL to preform analysis, create stimulating visualizations, and have informative conversations.
- In selecting our dataset the team was careful to select reputable sources erring on the side of caution. We wanted to ensure there was no bias in our data such as Algorithmic bias which refers to situations in which automated systems have a bias either in favor of or against certain groups of people. Lastly, we were careful to not include data that would have any PII (Personally Identifiable Information) to maintain privacy and prevent identity theft. With these items top of mind the team selected census.gov to obtain the primary data set. 
- For this project the team selected Pandas DataFrame. It was selected as the data collected from our sources are Two-Dimensional Structure with rows and columns. It will also allow users interacting with the data to utilize Labeled Axes to access, manipulate and perform analysis.
